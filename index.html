    <h2>Prusa Mendel I2 (Re)build</h2>
    <div id="date">written July 31, 2014</div>
    <p>This spring I purchased a partially completed Prusa Mendel i2 hobby 3D printer from another student at RIT. On initial inspection the printer looked fully assembled, but didn’t have the correct software. In all actuality, there was still quite a bit to fix before it would be ready to print.

    <h2>Fixing the Samsung Galaxy</h2>
    <p>I’ve had a Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone for a year now and it’s a good phone. However, the software that Samsung has put on top of stock android can be really awful in places and I’ve spent lots of time finding fixes. My phone runs the stock KitKat launcher, uses stock Google service apps, does all of its media from Google Play, and uses the stock Google camera app. These apps not only look much better visually, but provide a much better service than anything Samsung produces. Here’s how to set up these fixes on any device running Android KitKat or newer.</p>
    
    <h2>Artificial Intelligence for Gobblet</h2>
    <p>Recently I had the opportunity to design an AI to play the board game “Gobblet” for a team-based class project. At the end of the project all of the AIs entered in to a tournament against each other to determine which strategies were the most effective. My team’s AI ended up making it to the department finals; performing well against a variety of Gobblet strategies. Here I’m going to explain the basis of how our AI player was designed.</p>
