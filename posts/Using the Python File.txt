<p>
	The python file has three main commands:<br />
	1. generate: assembles layouts to create the site.<br />
	2. new_post: creates a new post with the proper header in the posts folder.<br />
	3. preview: constantly re-generates the site to allow you to view changes in the web browser as you edit. <br /><br />
	In order to run staticky you must have python 3.0+ installed on your computer.

	The staticky.py file is open source and easily editable using any text editor. Feel free to make changes for your specific site.
